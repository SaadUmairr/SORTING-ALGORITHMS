## How Can You Contribute

### Adding a Sorting Algorithm Implementation

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Make a new branch from the `main` branch for your work.
3. **Choose Your Language**: Go to the directory that matches your programming language (cpp, java, python, javascript).
4. **Add Your Implementation**: Create a new file named `AlgorithmName.extension` (e.g., `MergeSort.cpp`, `BubbleSort.java`) (Naming should follow camel case style) and write your sorting algorithm in it.
5. **Explain Your Code**: Include comments to explain how your algorithm works and any important steps.
6. **Keep It Neat**: Ensure your code adheres to the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines).
7. **Commit and Push**: Save your changes and push them to your forked repository.
8. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

### Enhancing Existing Implementations

1. **Follow the Same Steps**: Start by forking the repository and creating a new branch.
2. **Find Existing Code**: Locate the sorting algorithm implementation you want to improve.
3. **Make Enhancements**: Improve the code, fix bugs, or enhance its performance.
4. **Update Explanations**: If needed, update the comments and explanations.
5. **Style Matters**: Ensure your changes match the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines).
6. **Commit and Push**: Save your changes and push them to your forked repository.
7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

### Writing Articles

1. **Fork the Repository**: Just like before, start by forking the repository.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Make a new branch for your article.
3. **Write Your Article**: In the `articles` directory, create a file named `article_name.md`.
4. **Informative and Clear**: Write a detailed article about your chosen sorting algorithm. Use code snippets, examples, and clear explanations.
5. **Polish It**: Proofread your article for clarity and correctness.
6. **Commit and Push**: Save your article and push it to your forked repository.
7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

## Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request, please ensure the following:

- **New Branch**: Make sure your changes are in a new branch, not `main`.
- **Pass Tests**: Ensure your changes pass the tests and align with the style guidelines.
- **Explain Your Changes**: Provide a clear and concise explanation in the pull request description.
- **Descriptive Title**: Use a descriptive title that summarizes your contribution's purpose.

## Style Guidelines

- **Language Conventions**: Follow the coding conventions of your chosen programming language.
- **Clear Naming**: Use meaningful variable and function names.
- **Comments Matter**: Include comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, and important steps.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Keep formatting and indentation consistent.
- **File Headers**: Add a brief header comment to each file, describing its purpose and contents.
