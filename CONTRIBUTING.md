## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Be kind, respectful, and considerate in all interactions.

## How Can You Contribute

### Adding a Sorting Algorithm Implementation

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your feature: `git checkout -b add-algorithm-name`.
3. Navigate to the language-specific directory (cpp, java, python, javascript) in which you want to add the implementation.
4. Create a new file named `algorithm_name.extension` (e.g., `merge_sort.cpp`, `bubble_sort.java`).
5. Implement the sorting algorithm in the chosen language.
6. Include comments to explain the algorithm's logic and any important steps.
7. Make sure your code adheres to the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines).
8. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository.
9. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

### Enhancing Existing Implementations

1. Follow the steps 1-3 from the previous section.
2. Locate the existing implementation you want to enhance.
3. Make your enhancements, improvements, or bug fixes.
4. Update the comments and explanations if necessary.
5. Ensure your changes are in line with the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines).
6. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository.
7. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

### Writing Articles

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your article: `git checkout -b add-article-name`.
3. Create a new file named `article_name.md` in the `articles` directory.
4. Write a detailed and informative article about the sorting algorithm of your choice.
5. Include code snippets, examples, and explanations to make the article comprehensive.
6. Proofread your article for clarity and correctness.
7. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository.
8. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

## Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request, please ensure the following:

- Your changes are in a new branch, not `main`.
- Your changes pass the tests and adhere to the style guidelines.
- You provide a clear and concise explanation of your changes in the pull request description.
- Your pull request title is descriptive and summarizes the purpose of your contribution.

## Style Guidelines

- Follow the coding conventions of the respective language you're working in.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Include comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, and important steps.
- Use consistent formatting and indentation.
- Add a brief header comment to each file, describing its purpose and contents.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), allowing others to use, modify, and distribute your code and content for educational and non-commercial purposes.
